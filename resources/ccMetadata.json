The ERS creative class codes indicate a county's share of population employed in occupations that require \"thinking creatively.\" Variables used to construct the ERS creative class measure include number and percent employed in creative class occupations and a metro/nonmetro indicator for all counties, 1990, 2000, and 2007-11.
